# Javascript Math Toolkit

I had the idea several years ago to put together a high-quality math library for front-end developers.  This was also intended to be a place where I could bring together past code, written in a variety of languages ranging from C/C++ to Actionscript to JS, into a single code base.

At the early stages of this project, ES6 was 'just around the corner,' so I decided to write the initial code in native ES5.  _RequireJS_ was used as a module manager.  While I did not expect this to be the final version of the code, it served as a good 'holding area'

Dependencies:  _RequireJS_ (module manager) and _EaselJS_ (interactive demos)


## Remarks

This is beta-quality code.  That means there will be bugs.  I've found and fixed a few in the process of converting some of this code to the Typescript Math Toolkit.  Some of the 'classes' are not as DRY as I would like, but that's because of frequent copy-pasta used to quickly validate an algorithm.  Most of the tests are graphical and interactive.  Many were written before the function graphing engine, so once again you will see the results of lots of copy-pasta.  Some of the tests for edge cases are not as tight as I would like.  As I mentioned above, the initial goal was to get a lot of past code I authored from other languages into a common code base.

Do not treat this code as production-quality but as a means to explore the solution to various problems in an environment where people prefer looking at code to lots of equations.  If you would like to see this code moved to a high-quality, production environment, then [please support the Typescript Math Toolkit Project].

Please note that the code is provided 'as is'.  I do not have the bandwidth to support or answer questions about the code.  Thank you.


### Demos

1. demos are in the demos folder

2. load into your friendly, neighborhood browser; it's all rather crude as there was no formal test structure put in place for this 'holding' project
